## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application displays map, weather, yelp, movies, events and hiking data based on the city searched.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1) Obtain JSON files or database/APIs needed for grabbing data.
2) Create backend with express, cors, and dotenv.
3) Create get functions for different categories (i.e. weather, location, etc.)
4) Create constructor functions to normalize data.
5) Return data based on correct inputs.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
APIs needed:
    Google Maps
    Dark Sky
    Yelp
    The Movies DB
    EventBrite
    Hiking Project
